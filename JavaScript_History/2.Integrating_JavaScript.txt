How JavaScript Refers HTML elemtents?
1) JavaScript can refer HTML elements by using DOM hierachy. 
- If you change the position of any element in page, then every time you have to update its position in code.
- It is faster in rendering

2) JavaScript can refer elements by using "name".
- You can access any element directly by using its reference name.
- You can't access child elements directly.
- You have to refer both parent and child hierachy.

3) You can refer by using "ID"
    document.getElementById()
- Every element can be configured with only one ID.
- ID have conflict with CSS reference
- ID is not required if you are accessing any direct document element.

4) JavaScript can refer any element by using CSS selectors
    document.querySelector()
- Query selector can apply effects only to the firt element.
- How ever it can handle data for multiple elements.
- It can also handle styles for multiple elements.
Syntax:
        document.querySelector("h2")          // type selector
        document.querySelector("#pic")        // id selector
        document.querySelector(".pic")        // class selector
    
5) JavaScript can refer all elements having common Name
    document.getElementsByName()
