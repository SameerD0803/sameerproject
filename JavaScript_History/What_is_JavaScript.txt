                        JavaScript

- JavaScript is light weight interpretted and JIT compiled programming language.
- Interpretted language translates line by line of program.
- Compiled language translates all lines simultaneously at the same time.
- Compling techniques are 2 types
        a) JIT     [ Just-In-Time ]
        b) AOT     [ Ahead-of-Time]

- JIT translates the program at browser.
- AOT translates the program at application.
- JavaScript compilers are
        a) V8
        b) Babel
- JavaScript is a language which is used
        a) Client Side            => With HTML
        b) Server Side            => NodeJS
        c) Database               => MongoDB
        d) Animation Tools        => Adobe Flash, 3DS Max, CAD

- It was later renamed as "Live Script".
- Netscape given the responsibility of maintaining LiveScript to a company called "Sun Micro Systems". [Java]
- Sun Micro Systems renamed "Live Script" as "JavaScript".
- Brendan Eich is Father of JavaScript.
- In early 2002  Netscape stopped its services, and given the responsibility of JavaScript to "ECMA". [European Computer Manufacturers Association]
- JavaScript versions are developed and maintained by ECMA.
- JavaScript latest versions
